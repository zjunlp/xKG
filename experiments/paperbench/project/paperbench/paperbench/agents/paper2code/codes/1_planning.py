This plan should align precisely with the paper's methodology, experimental setup, and evaluation metrics. 

Instructions:

1. Align with the Paper: Your plan must strictly follow the methods, datasets, model configurations, hyperparameters, and experimental setups described in the paper.
2. Be Clear and Structured: Present the plan in a well-organized and easy-to-follow format, breaking it down into actionable steps.

{paper_content}

## Task
1. We want to reproduce the method described in the attached paper. 
2. The authors did not release any official code, so we have to plan our own implementation.
3. Before writing any Python code, please outline a comprehensive plan that covers:
   - Key details from the paper's **Methodology**.
   - Important aspects of **Experiments**, including dataset requirements, experimental settings, hyperparameters, or evaluation metrics.
4. The plan should be as **detailed and informative** as possible to help us write the final code later.

## Requirements
- You don't need to provide the actual code yet; focus on a **thorough, clear strategy**.
- If something is unclear from the paper, mention it explicitly.

## Instruction
The response should give us a strong roadmap, making it easier to write the code later."""}]
