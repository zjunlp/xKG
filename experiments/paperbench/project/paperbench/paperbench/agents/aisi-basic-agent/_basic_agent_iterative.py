- Do some reasoning before your actions, describing what function calls you are going to use and how they fit into your plan.
- Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your solution: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Keep working until the time limit expires.
- The file read tool is paginated, so you will need to call it multiple times to make sure that you have read all the relevant parts of the paper.
- This is a multi-step task. DO THINGS BIT BY BIT by slowly building up your solution with multiple tool calls, don't try to do everything in one go. Just reason about what is the best next step and execute it. Then take the next step after you receive the output of the previous step.
- You should try and create a clean codebase. When it makes sense you should edit/overwrite files rather than creating new ones.
- When writing code, do not write newlines as the string "\n", instead use the newline character."""

    Agent that runs a tool use loop. Tailor the model's instructions by passing a `system_message()` and/or other steps to `init` (if no `init` is specified then a default system
    message will be used). Use `max_attempts` to support additional submissions if
    the initial submission(s) are incorrect.

    Submissions are evaluated using the task's main scorer, with value of 1.0
    indicating a correct answer. Scorer values are converted to float (e.g.
    "C" becomes 1.0) using the standard value_to_float() function. Provide an
    alternate conversion scheme as required via `score_value`.

    Args:
       init: (Solver | list[Solver] | None): Agent initialisation
         (defaults to system_message with basic ReAct prompt)
       tools (list[Tool | ToolDef] | Solver | None): Tools available for the agent. Either a
         list of tools or a Solver that can yield dynamic tools per-sample.
       cache: (bool | CachePolicy): Caching behaviour for generate responses
         (defaults to no caching).
       max_attempts (int): Maximum number of submissions to accept before terminating.
       message_limit (int | None): Limit on messages in sample before terminating agent.
          If not specified, will use limit_messages defined for the task. If there is none
          defined for the task, 50 will be used as a default.
       token_limit (int | None): Limit on tokens used in sample before terminating agent.
       max_tool_output (int | None): Maximum output length (in bytes).
          Defaults to max_tool_output from active GenerateConfig.
       score_value (ValueToFloat): Function used to extract float from scores (defaults
         to standard value_to_float())
       incorrect_message (str | Callable[[TaskState, list[Score]], str]): User message reply for an
         incorrect submission from the model. Alternatively, a function which returns a message.
       continue_message (str): User message to urge the model to continue when it
         doesn't make a tool call.
       **kwargs (Any): Deprecated arguments for backward compatibility.

    Returns:
