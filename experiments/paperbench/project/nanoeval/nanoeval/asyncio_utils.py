    """Cancel a future/task and await for it to finish.

    Background: the function implements a few best practices of asyncio task
    cancellation. Use this function instead of these less correct alternatives:

    1. Just `task.cancel()`. This schedules a CancelledError to be thrown into
    the task at some point in the future. Two common problems with this:
        a. If `task` reference is garbage collected before the exception is
        produced inside the task (e.g. `task = None`), the task might be just
        "silently interrupted" without any exception, skipping `finally:` and
        context manager exits.
        b. If the task has failed with any exception it will be silently hidden.
    2. `task.cancel()` followed by `await task`. This mitigates the above
    issues, but also requires catching the CancelledError propagated from the
    cancelled task, e.g.
        try:
            task.cancel()
            await task
        except CancelledError:
            pass
    This approach has a bug in case the "parent" task that calls `task.cancel()`
    is itself cancelled. The `try/except` will silently swallow the
    CancelledError leading to unexpected results.

    If the fut is already done() this is a no-op
    If everything goes well this returns None.

    If this coroutine is cancelled, we wait for the passed in argument to cancel
    but we will raise the CancelledError as per Cancellation Contract, Unless the task
    doesn't cancel correctly then we could raise other exceptions.

    If the task raises an exception during cancellation we re-raise it
    if the task completes instead of cancelling we raise a InvalidStateError
